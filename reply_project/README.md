Before start coding you always need to start your Virtual Environment: Run \Scripts\activate.bat in your console. Useally you will see the project name (reply-project) in console anywhere.

## Install dependencies
Navigate inside best-project folder and run pip install requirements.txt

Attentation: If you manually install any further dependencies run pip freeze > requirements.txt within reply-project folder afterwards to update the dependency file.
