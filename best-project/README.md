## Virtual Environment Setup
Before start coding you always need to start your Virtual Environment:
Run 
 \Scripts\activate.bat
in your console. Useally you will see the project name (best-project) in console anywhere.

## Install dependencies
Navigate inside best-project folder and run
 pip install requirements.txt

Attentation: If you manually install any further dependencies run
 pip freeze > requirements.txt 
within best-project folder afterwards to update the dependency file.
